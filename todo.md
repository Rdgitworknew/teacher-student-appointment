## Implementation Strategy
- Start with Firebase setup and authentication
- Implement role-based routing and dashboards
- Add core appointment booking functionality
- Implement messaging system
- Add search and filtering capabilities
- Include proper error handling and logging

## Database Schema (Firestore)
- **users** collection: user profiles with roles
- **teachers** collection: teacher information
- **appointments** collection: appointment records
- **messages** collection: student-teacher messages

## Security Rules
- Implement Firestore security rules for role-based access
- Ensure students can only access their own data
- Teachers can only manage their appointments
- Admins have full access to teacher management
